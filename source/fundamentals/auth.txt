In this guide, we show you how to authenticate with MongoDB using each
**authentication mechanism** available in the MongoDB Community Edition.
Authentication mechanisms are processes by which the driver and server
confirm identity and establish trust to ensure security.

The mechanisms that you can use with the latest version of MongoDB Community
Edition are as follows:

* Default
* SCRAM-SHA-256
* SCRAM-SHA-1
* MONGODB-CR
* MONGODB-AWS
* X.509

To authenticate using ``Kerberos`` or ``LDAP``, see the
:doc:`Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms guide </fundamentals/enterprise-auth>`.
For more information on establishing a connection to your MongoDB cluster,
read our :doc:`Connection Guide </fundamentals/connection>`.
