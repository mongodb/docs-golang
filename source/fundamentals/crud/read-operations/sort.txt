Sort Results

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use ``sort()`` to change the order in which read operations return
documents. The ``sort()`` instance method tells MongoDB to order returned documents by the
values of one or more fields in a certain direction. To sort returned
documents by a field in ascending (lowest first) order, use the static method ``Sorts.ascending()``,
specifying the field on which to sort. To sort in descending (greatest first) order instead,
use the static method ``Sorts.descending()``, specifying the field on which to sort. For example,
you can sort on ``id`` or ``name`` fields. If you do not specify a sort, MongoDB does not
guarantee the order of query results.
