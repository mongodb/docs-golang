====================================
Limit the Number of Returned Results
====================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Use ``limit()`` to cap the number of documents that a read operation returns.
This instance method designates the maximum number of
documents that a read operation can return. If there are not enough documents
to reach the specified limit, it can return a smaller number.
If you use ``limit()`` with the ``skip()`` (TODO: link) instance method, the skip applies
first and the limit only applies to the documents left over after
the skip.
