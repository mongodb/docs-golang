Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to
perform **bulk operations**. Bulk operations reduce the number
of calls to the server by performing multiple write operations
in a single method.

The ``Collection`` and ``Client`` classes both provide a ``BulkWrite()``
method. When calling ``BulkWrite()`` on a ``Collection`` instance, you can
perform multiple write operations on a single collection. When calling
``BulkWrite()`` on a ``Client`` instance, you can perform bulk writes across
multiple namespaces. In MongoDB, a namespace consists of the database name and the collection
name in the format ``<database>.<collection>``. 

.. important::

   To perform bulk operations on a ``Client`` instance,
   ensure that your application meets the following
   requirements:

   - Uses {+driver-short+} v2.1 or later 
   - Connects to {+mdb-server+} v8.0 or later

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the following structs:

- ``Book`` struct, which models documents in the ``db.books`` collection.
  Each document contains a description of a book that includes the title,
  author, and page length.

- ``Poem`` struct, which models documents in the ``db.poems`` collection.
  Each document contains a description of a poem that includes the title,
  author, and publication year.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :start-after: start-structs
   :end-before: end-structs
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To run the examples in this guide, load the sample data into the
``books`` and ``poems`` collection by using the following snippet:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin insertDocs
   :end-before: end insertDocs

.. include:: /includes/fundamentals/automatic-db-coll-creation.rst

Write to One Namespace
----------------------

To perform a bulk operation on a single namespace, call the ``BulkWrite()``
method on a collection and pass an array of :ref:`WriteModel <golang-write-model-collection>`
documents as a parameter.

Modify Collection.BulkWrite() Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the behavior of your bulk write operation, pass a ``BulkWriteOptions``
instance to the ``BulkWrite()`` method.

The ``BulkWriteOptions`` type allows you to configure options by using the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Specifies whether the operation can opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetOrdered()``
     - | Specifies whether the driver stops performing write operations after an error occurs. 
       | Default: ``true``

Collection.BulkWrite() Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BulkWrite()`` method returns a ``BulkWriteResult`` type, which
includes information about the bulk operation.

The ``BulkWriteResult`` type contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``InsertedCount``
     - The number of documents inserted.

   * - ``MatchedCount``
     - The number of documents matched by the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` in update and replace operations.

   * - ``ModifiedCount``
     - The number of documents modified by update and replace operations.

   * - ``DeletedCount``
     - The number of documents deleted.
   
   * - ``UpsertedCount`` 
     - The number of documents :ref:`upserted <golang-upsert-definition>` by update and replace operations.

   * - ``UpsertedIDs`` 
     - A map of an operation index to the ``_id`` of each :ref:`upserted <golang-upsert-definition>` document.

Write to Multiple Namespaces
----------------------------

To perform a bulk operation across multiple namespaces, call the
``BulkWrite()`` method on your client and pass an array of
:ref:`ClientWriteModel <golang-write-model-client>` documents as a parameter.

Modify Client.BulkWrite() Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify the behavior of your bulk write operation, pass a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions``
instance to the ``BulkWrite()`` method.

The ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` type allows you to configure options by using the
following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetBypassDocumentValidation()`` 
     - | Specifies whether the operation can opt-out of document level validation.
       | Default: ``false``

   * - ``SetOrdered()``
     - | Specifies whether the driver stops performing write operations after an error occurs. 
       | Default: ``true``

   * - ``SetComment()``
     - | Specifies a comment to attach to the operation.
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetLet()``
     - | Specifies parameters for update and delete operations, which improves command
         readability by separating the variables from the query text.
       | Default: none

   * - ``SetWriteConcern()``
     - | Specifies the write concern for the operations. 
       | Default: ``nil``

   * - ``SetVerboseResults()``
     - | Specifies whether detailed information about each successful operation is
         included in the result.
       | Default: ``false``

Client.BulkWrite() Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``BulkWrite()`` method returns a ``ClientBulkWriteResult`` type, which
includes information about the bulk operation.

The ``ClientBulkWriteResult`` type contains the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Property
     - Description

   * - ``InsertedCount``
     - The number of documents inserted.

   * - ``MatchedCount``
     - The number of documents matched by the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` in update and replace operations.

     - A map of an operation index to the ``_id`` value of each updated document.

   * - ``DeleteResults`` 
     - A map of an operation index to the ``_id`` value of each deleted document.

   * - ``Acknowledged`` 
     - A boolean value that indicates whether the write operation was acknowledged.

   * - ``HasVerboseResults`` 
     - A boolean value that indicates whether the result contains detailed results.

Define Collection-Level Operations
----------------------------------

To define the write operations for your bulk operation on one
namespace, create a ``WriteModel`` for each insert, replace,
update, or delete.

InsertOneModel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define an insert operation for a bulk write, create an
``InsertOneModel`` specifying the document you want to insert. To 
insert multiple documents, create an ``InsertOneModel`` for each
document you want to insert.

You can specify the behavior of the ``InsertOneModel`` by
using the following method:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetDocument()`` 
     - | The document to insert.

Example
```````

This following example creates two ``InsertOneModel`` instances to
insert two documents into the ``books`` collection:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk insert model collection
   :end-before: end bulk insert model collection

ReplaceOneModel

a ``ReplaceOneModel`` specifying the document you want
replace and a replacement document. To replace multiple
documents, create a ``ReplaceOneModel`` for each document
you want to replace.

You can specify the behavior of the ``ReplaceOneModel`` by
using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Method
     - Description

   * - ``SetCollation()`` 
     - | The type of language collation to use when sorting results.

         replaces only the first document according to the sort criteria.

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` doesn't match any documents.

Example
```````

The following example creates a ``ReplaceOneModel`` to replace a
document in the ``books`` collection in which the ``title`` value is ``"Lucy"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk replace model collection
   :end-before: end bulk replace model collection

UpdateOneModel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define an update operation for a bulk write, create
an ``UpdateOneModel`` specifying the document you want to update
and an :ref:`update document <golang-update-document>`. To update
multiple documents, use an ``UpdateManyModel``.

You can specify the behavior of each of the update models
by using the following methods:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``SetUpsert()`` 
     - | Whether to insert a new document if the :ref:`query filter <golang-query-filter-definition>` doesn't match any documents.

Example
```````

The following example creates an ``UpdateOneModel`` to update
a document in the ``books`` collection, decrementing a
document's ``length`` by ``15`` if the ``author`` is ``"Elena Ferrante"``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk update model collection
   :end-before: end bulk update model collection

   :language: go
   :dedent:
   :start-after: begin bulk delete model client
   :end-before: end bulk delete model client

Collection-Level Execution Order
--------------------------------

To specify whether the bulk write performs the operations
in order or unordered, you can set the ``Ordered`` option
to a boolean value. To set this option, specify the ``Ordered``
field of a ``BulkWriteOptions`` instance.

Ordered
~~~~~~~

By default, the ``BulkWrite()`` method runs bulk operations in
order you added them and stops if an error occurs.

.. tip::

   This is equivalent to passing a value of ``true`` to the ``SetOrdered()``
   method, as shown in the following code: 

   .. code-block:: go
     
      opts := options.BulkWrite().SetOrdered(true)

Unordered
~~~~~~~~~

To run bulk write operations in any order and continue if an error
occurs, pass a value of ``false`` to the ``SetOrdered()`` method. The method
reports errors after the operation completes.

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions in any order: 

- Inserts two documents
- Replaces a document where the ``title`` is "My Brilliant Friend" with a new document
- Increments every document's ``length`` by ``10`` if the current
  ``length`` value is less than ``200``
- Deletes all documents where the ``author`` field value includes ``"Jam"``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
      :start-after: begin unordered collection
      :end-before: end unordered collection
      :language: go
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Number of documents inserted: 2
      Number of documents replaced or updated: 2
      Number of documents deleted: 1

The following documents are present in the ``books`` collection after
the bulk operation:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   {"title":"Atonement","author":"Ian McEwan","length":351}
   {"title":"Middlemarch","author":"George Eliot","length":904}
   {"title":"Pale Fire","author":"Vladimir Nabokov","length":246}

Client-Level Execution Order
----------------------------

To specify whether the bulk write performs the operations
in order or unordered, you can set the ``Ordered`` option
to a boolean value. To set this option, specify the ``Ordered``
field of a ``ClientBulkWriteOptions`` instance.

Ordered
~~~~~~~

By default, the ``BulkWrite()`` method executes bulk operations in
order you added them and stops if an error occurs.

.. tip::

   This is equivalent to passing a value of ``true`` to the ``SetOrdered()``
   method, as shown in the following code: 

   .. code-block:: go
      
      opts := options.ClientBulkWrite().SetOrdered(true)

Unordered
~~~~~~~~~

To run bulk write operations in any order and continue if an error
occurs, pass a value of ``false`` to the ``SetOrdered()`` method. The method
reports errors after the operation completes.

Example
```````

The following example performs the following actions in any order: 

- Inserts a new document into the ``books`` and ``poems`` collections
- Updates a document in the ``poems`` collection that has a ``title``
  value of ``"The Raincoat"``
- Replaces a document in the ``books`` collection that has a ``title``
  value of ``"My Brilliant Friend"``

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/bulkOps.go
      :start-after: begin unordered client
      :end-before: end unordered client
      :language: go
      :dedent:

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      Number of documents inserted: 2
      Number of documents replaced or updated: 2
