Overview
--------

MongoDB organizes data into a hierachy of the following levels:

- databases

- collections

- documents

Databases are the top level of data organization in a MongoDB instance.
Databases are organized into collections which contain **documents**.
Documents
contain literal data such as strings, numbers, and dates as well as
other (embedded) documents. For more information on document field
types and structure, see the server documentation for :manual:`documents
<core/document/>`.
