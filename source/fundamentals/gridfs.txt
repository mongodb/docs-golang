Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to store and retrieve large files in
MongoDB using **GridFS**. GridFS is a specification that describes how
to split files into chunks when storing them and reassemble the files when
retrieving them. The driver implementation of GridFS is an abstraction that
manages the operations and organization of the file storage. 

You should use GridFS if the size of your files exceed the BSON document
size limit of 16MB. GridFS is also useful for accessing files without loading
the entire file into memory. For more detailed information on whether GridFS
is suitable for your use case, see the :manual:`GridFS server manual page </core/gridfs>`.

How GridFS Works
----------------

GridFS organizes files in a **bucket**, a group of MongoDB collections
that contain the chunks of files and information describing them. The
bucket contains the following collections:

- The ``chunks`` collection, which stores the binary file chunks.
- The ``files`` collection, which stores the file metadata.

When you create a new GridFS bucket, the driver creates the preceding 
collections, prefixed with the default bucket name ``fs``, unless
you specify a different name. The driver also creates an index on each
collection to ensure efficient retrieval of the files and related
metadata. The driver only creates the GridFS bucket on the first write
operation if it does not already exist. The driver only creates indexes if
they do not exist and when the bucket is empty. For more information on
GridFS indexes, see the server manual page on :manual:`GridFS Indexes </core/gridfs/#gridfs-indexes>`.

When storing files with GridFS, the driver splits the files into smaller
chunks, each represented by a separate document in the ``chunks`` collection.
It also creates a document in the ``files`` collection that contains
a file ID, file name, and other file metadata. You can upload the file from
memory or from a stream. See the following diagram to see how GridFS splits
the files when uploaded to a bucket.

.. figure:: /includes/figures/GridFS-upload.png
   :alt: A diagram that shows how GridFS uploads a file to a bucket

When retrieving files, GridFS fetches the metadata from the ``files``
collection in the specified bucket and uses the information to reconstruct
the file from documents in the ``chunks`` collection. You can read the file
into memory or output it to a stream.

Use GridFS

- :ref:`Upload Files <golang-upload-files>`
- :ref:`Retrieve File Information <golang-retrieve-info>`

.. _golang-create-bucket:

Create a GridFS Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To store or retrieve files from GridFS, create a bucket or get a reference to
an existing bucket on a MongoDB database. To create a ``GridFSBucket`` instance,
call the ``NewBucket()`` method with a database parameter:

.. code-block:: go

   db := client.Database("myDB")
   bucket, err := gridfs.NewBucket(db)
   if err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

.. note::

   The ``NewBucket()`` method instantiates a bucket if one does not already exist. 
   However, the bucket is only created when you upload your first file.

To instantiate a bucket with a custom name other than the default name ``fs``,
call the ``SetName()`` method on a ``BucketOptions`` instance. Then, pass this code
as a second parameter to the ``NewBucket()`` method:

.. code-block:: go

   db := client.Database("myDB")
   opts := options.GridFSBucket().SetName("custom name")
   bucket, err := gridfs.NewBucket(db, opts)
   
   if err != nil {
      panic(err)
   }

.. _golang-upload-files:

Upload Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can upload a file into a GridFS bucket in one of the following ways:

- Use the ``UploadFromStream()`` method, which reads from an input stream
- Use the ``OpenUploadStream()`` method, which writes to an output stream

For either upload process, you can specify configuration information on an instance
of ``UploadOptions``. For a full list of ``UploadOptions`` fields, visit the 
`API documentation <{+api+}/mongo/options#UploadOptions>`__.

Upload with an Input Stream
```````````````````````````

You can use an input stream to upload a file to a GridFS bucket. To upload a file,
use the ``UploadFromStream()`` method with the following parameters:

- Your file name
- An ``io.Reader``, with your opened file as a parameter
- An optional ``opts`` parameter to modify the behavior of ``UploadFromStream()``

The following code example reads from a file called ``"file.txt"`` and uploads the content
to a GridFS bucket. It uses an ``opts`` parameter to set file metadata:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      fileContent, err := os.Open("path/to/file.txt")
	  uploadOpts := options.GridFSUpload().SetMetadata(bson.D{{"metadata tag", "first"}})
	  
	  objectID, err := bucket.UploadFromStream("file.txt", io.Reader(fileContent),
         uploadOpts)
      if err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }

	  fmt.Printf("New file uploaded with ID %s", objectID)

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      New file uploaded with ID 62e005408bc04f3816b8bcd2

.. note::

   The driver uniquely generates each object ID number. The ID number outputted will
   resemble the sample output but varies with each file and user.

Upload with an Output Stream
````````````````````````````

You can use an output stream to upload a file to a GridFS bucket. To upload a file,
use the ``OpenUploadStream()`` method with the following parameters:

- Your file name
- An optional ``opts`` parameter to modify the behavior of ``OpenUploadStream()``

The following code example opens an upload stream on a GridFS bucket and sets the number
of bytes in each chunk with an ``opts`` parameter. Then, it calls the ``Write()`` method
on the content of ``"file.txt"`` to write its content to the stream:

.. io-code-block::
   :copyable: true

   .. input::
      :language: go

      fileContent, err := os.Open("path/to/file.txt")
      uploadOpts := options.GridFSUpload().SetChunkSizeBytes(200)
      uploadStream, err := bucket.OpenUploadStream("file.txt", uploadOpts)

      if bytes, err = uploadStream.Write(fileContent); err != nil {
         panic(err)
      }

      fmt.Printf("New file uploaded with %d bytes written", bytes)

   .. output::
      :language: none
      :visible: false

      New file uploaded with 1000 bytes written

.. _golang-retrieve-info:

Retrieve File Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, you can learn how to retrieve file metadata stored in the files
collection of the GridFS bucket.

Call the ``Find()`` method on a ``Bucket`` instance.

- Function: 
   func (b *Bucket) Find(filter interface{}, opts ...*options.GridFSFindOptions)
- Example: 
   filter := bson.D{
		{"length", bson.D{{"$gt", 1000}}},
	}
	cursor, err := bucket.Find(filter)
   // iterating:
   type gridfsFile struct {
		Name   string `bson:"filename"`
		Length int64  `bson:"length"`
	}
   var foundFiles []gridfsFile
	if err = cursor.All(context.TODO(), &foundFiles); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	for _, file := range foundFiles {
		fmt.Printf("filename: %s, length: %d\n", file.Name, file.Length)
	}

.. _golang-download-files:

Download Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to uploading files, there are two ways to download GridFS files. You can download
a file directly to a stream or you can save it to memory from a stream. 

Download a File to an Output Stream
```````````````````````````````````

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket directly to an output stream using the
``DownloadToStream()`` method.

This method takes an io.Writer parameter, which represents the download destination. It
internally create a new DownloadStream and closes it once the operation is complete.

- Function: 
   func (b *Bucket) DownloadToStream(fileID interface{}, stream io.Writer)
- Example:
	var bucket *gridfs.Bucket
	var fileID primitive.ObjectID

	fileBuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(nil)
	if _, err := bucket.DownloadToStream(fileID, fileBuffer); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

Download a File to an Input Stream
``````````````````````````````````

You can download a file in a GridFS bucket to memory by using an input stream. Call
the ``OpenDownloadStream()`` method on the GridFS bucket.

This method returns a ``DownloadStream`` instance, which you can then read with the 
``Read()`` method.

- Function:
   func (b *Bucket) OpenDownloadStream(fileID interface{})
- Example:
	var bucket *gridfs.Bucket
	var fileID primitive.ObjectID

	downloadStream, err := bucket.OpenDownloadStream(fileID)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

   fileBuffer := bytes.NewBuffer(nil)
	if _, err := downloadStream.Read(fileBuffer); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

.. _golang-rename-files:

Rename Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update the name of a GridFS file in your bucket by calling the ``Rename()``
method on the GridFS bucket. Pass the file ID as an argument to ``Rename()``. 

- Function:
   func (b *Bucket) Rename(fileID interface{}, newFilename string)
- Example:
	var bucket *gridfs.Bucket
	var fileID primitive.ObjectID

	if err := bucket.Rename(fileID, "new file name"); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

.. _golang-delete-files:

Delete Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove a file from your GridFS bucket by calling the ``Delete()`` method on
the GridFS bucket. Pass the file ID as an argument to ``Delete()``. 

- Function:
   func (b *Bucket) Delete(fileID interface{})
- Example:
   var bucket *gridfs.Bucket
	var fileID primitive.ObjectID

	if err := bucket.Delete(fileID); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

.. _golang-delete-bucket:

Delete a GridFS Bucket
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a GridFS bucket by calling the ``Drop()`` method on the bucket.

- Function: 
   func (b *Bucket) Drop()
- Example:
   var bucket *gridfs.Bucket

	if err := bucket.Drop(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
