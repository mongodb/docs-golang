Client-Side Field Level Encryption

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) allows you to encrypt
specific data fields within a document with your MongoDB client application before sending the data to the server.
Starting in MongoDB 4.2 Enterprise, you can perform this client-side encryption automatically.

With CSFLE, your client application encrypts fields client-side without requiring any server-side configuration or
directives. CSFLE is useful for situations in which applications must guarantee that unauthorized parties, including
server administrators, cannot read the encrypted data.
