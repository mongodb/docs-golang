Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and a
``MongoClient`` object to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

.. tip::

   To learn more about how to retrieve or format your connection string, see 
   the :ref:`Connection URI <golang-connection-uri>` guide in 
   the Go Connection Guide.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements in your
connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster
- MongoDB username
- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`<stable-api>`
guide.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code also uses the ``server_api`` field to specify a {+stable-api+} version.
