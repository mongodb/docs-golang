Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use a connection string and a
``MongoClient`` object to connect to different types of MongoDB deployments.

.. tip::

   To learn more about how to retrieve or format your connection string, see 
   the :ref:`Connection URI <golang-connection-uri>` guide in 
   the Go Connection Guide.

Atlas
-----

To connect to a MongoDB deployment on Atlas, include the following elements in your
connection string:

- URL of your Atlas cluster
- MongoDB username
- MongoDB password

Then, pass your connection string to the ``MongoClient`` constructor.

When you connect to Atlas, we recommend using the {+stable-api+} client option to avoid
breaking changes when Atlas upgrades to a new version of {+mdb-server+}.
To learn more about the {+stable-api+} feature, see the :ref:`<stable-api>`
guide.

The following code shows how to use the {+driver-short+} to connect to an Atlas cluster. The
code also uses the ``server_api`` field to specify a {+stable-api+} version.

Replica Set
-----------

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that
store the same set of data. This configuration provides data
redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname and port numbers
of each instance, separated by commas, and the replica set name as the value
of the ``replicaSet`` parameter in the connection string. In the following
example, the hostnames are ``host1``, ``host2``, and ``host3``, and the
port numbers are all ``27017``. The replica set name is ``myRS``.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRS

When connecting to a replica set, the driver takes the following actions by default:

- Discovers all replica set members when given the address of any one member.
- Dispatches operations to the appropriate member, such as instructions
  to write against the **primary**.

.. tip::

   You can specify just one host to connect to a replica set.
   However, to ensure connectivity when the specified host
   is unavailable, you should provide the full list of hosts.

Direct Connection
`````````````````

To force operations on the host designated in the connection URI,
specify the ``directConnection`` option. Direct connections exhibit the
following behavior:

- They don't support SRV strings.
- They fail on writes when the specified host is not the **primary**.
- They require you to specify a :manual:`secondary read preference
  </core/read-preference/#mongodb-readmode-secondary>` when the
  specified host isn't the **primary** node.
