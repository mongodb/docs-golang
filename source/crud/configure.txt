Retryable Reads and Writes
--------------------------

{+driver-short+} automatically retries certain read and write operations a single time
if they fail due to a network or server error.

You can explicitly disable retryable reads or retryable writes by setting the
``retryReads`` or ``retryWrites`` option to ``False`` when creating a new client
by using the ``options.Client`` struct. 

The following example disables retryable reads and writes for a client:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/fundamentals/code-snippets/CRUD/retryableReadsWrites.go
   :start-after: start-retryable-example
   :end-before: end-retryable-example
   :language: go
   :dedent:

To learn more about supported retryable read operations, see :manual:`Retryable Reads </core/retryable-reads/>`
in the {+mdb-server+} manual. To learn more about supported retryable write
operations, see :manual:`Retryable Writes </core/retryable-writes/>` in the {+mdb-server+} manual.
