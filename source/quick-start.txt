Set up Your Project
-------------------

Initialize with Go Mod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new directory and initialize your project with ``go mod``.

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir go-quickstart
   cd go-quickstart
   go mod init go-quickstart

.. _add-mongodb-dependency:

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``go get`` to add the Go driver as a dependency.

.. code-block:: shell

   go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/atlas-setup.rst


Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, create a file to contain your application called ``main.go``
in the base directory of your project. Use the following sample
code to run a query on your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas.

Set the value of the ``uri`` variable with your MongoDB Atlas connection
string, or create an environmental variable with the name ``MONGODB_URI``
with your Atlas connection string.

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_URI='<your atlas connection string>'

.. note::

   Make sure to replace the "<password>" section of the connection string with
   the password you created for your user that has **atlasAdmin** permissions.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/main.go
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   go run main.go

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/query-output.rst

.. tip::

   If your output is empty, ensure you have loaded the
   :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data/>` into your cluster.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the Go driver to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
sample data, and print out the result.
