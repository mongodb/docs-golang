Watch for Changes

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can keep track of changes to data in MongoDB, such as changes to a
collection, database, or deployment, by opening a **change stream**. A change
stream allows applications to watch for changes to data and react to them.
The change stream returns **change event** documents when changes occur.
