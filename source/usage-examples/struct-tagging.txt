===============
Use Struct Tags
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can specify the way that the Go Driver converts Go
structs to :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types/>` using struct tags.

The following code declares a ``BlogPost`` struct, where the ``WordCount`` field
has a struct tag that sets a custom BSON field name of ``word_count``.
By default, the driver marshals the other fields as the lowercase of the struct
field name:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin struct
   :end-before: end struct
   :language: go
   :dedent:

The following example creates a ``BlogPost`` instance and inserts it
into the ``posts`` collection. During the insert operation, the driver
interprets the struct tag to marshal the ``WordCount``
struct field as ``word_count``:

.. include:: /includes/usage-examples/run-example-tip.rst

.. literalinclude:: /includes/usage-examples/code-snippets/struct-tag.go
   :start-after: begin create and insert
   :end-before: end create and insert
   :language: go
   :dedent:

Expected Result
---------------

After running the preceding code snippet, you should be able to find
the following document in the ``posts`` collection:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("..."),
       "title" : "Annuals vs. Perennials?",
       "author" : "Sam Lee",
       "word_count" : 682,
       "lastupdated": ...,
       "tags" : ["seasons", "gardening", "flower"]
   }

A Document Usage Example </usage-examples/findOne>`.
