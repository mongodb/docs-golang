=======================
Perform Bulk Operations
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb


The ``bulkWrite()`` method performs batch write operations against a
*single* collection. This method reduces the number of network round trips from
your application to the server which therefore increases the potential
throughput and performance. Since you only receive the success status after
all the operations return, we recommend you use this if that meets the
requirements of your use case.
