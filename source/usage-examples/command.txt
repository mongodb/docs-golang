.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can run all raw database operations using the
``MongoDatabase.runCommand()`` method. A raw database operation is a
command you can execute directly on the MongoDB server CLI. These
commands include administrative and diagnostic tasks, such as fetching
server stats or initializing a replica set. Call the ``runCommand()``
method with a Bson command object on an instance of a ``MongoDatabase``
to run your raw database operation.

.. note::
    Use the :manual:`mongo shell </reference/mongo-shell>` for
    administrative tasks instead of the Go driver whenever possible,
    since these tasks are often quicker and easier to implement with the
    shell than in a Go application.
